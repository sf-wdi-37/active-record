In this lab we will explore the "M" in our "MVC" (Model View Controller) Rails architecture by building an application for a fashion conference.

Lab Goals:
* Generate `Speaker` and `Talk` models
* Use ActiveRecord ORM methods to create and query records
* Write a seed file and run the `db:seed` task to populate the database with records
* Add validations and custom methods to models for richer behavior

## A Rails App with Speakers

1. **Create a new rails application**

  We're using the `rails new` command on the command-line to auto-magically create and configure our Rails application.

  Try typing `rails --help` in your Terminal, and you'll see this informative output:

  ```bash
      Usage:
        rails new APP_PATH [options]
  ```

  Let's try it out!


  ``` bash
  # rails new APP_PATH [options]
  rails new conference_app -T -d postgresql
  cd conference_app
  ```

  > We are using the `-T` (aka `--skip-test-unit`) and `-d postgresql` (aka `--database postgresql`) options today -- postgresl is our preferred database. We'll talk about tests another day.

  Stop and commit!
  ``` bash
  git add . -A # add everything
  git commit -m "inital commit, rails application boilerplate"
  ```

  Take a moment to look around at your new app's file structure.

1. **Generate a `Speaker` model.**

  ``` bash
  rails generate model speaker first:string last:string email:string
  git diff # show the files you just created!
  ```

  > `rails g` is shorthand for `rails generate`

  Examine the following new files:  
  * `app/models/speaker.rb`
  * `db/migrate/1234566789_create_speakers.rb`

  And take another look at your updated `db/schema.rb`!


  Stop and commit. Then run `git diff` to see what changed.

1. **Set up the database.**
  Next, create your application database:
  ```bash
  rake db:create # create a new database on your machine
  rake db:migrate # instruct your database to read and execute migration files
  ```

  > You may see errors if postgresql isn't configured/linked correctly on your machine. Flag down an instructor for help. As a last resort, download and then launch Postgres.app. You will see an elephant in your menu if it's running.

  <details><summary>What is Rake?</summary>
    Rake is Ruby Make, a standalone Ruby utility that replaces the Unix utility `make`, and uses a `Rakefile` and `.rake` files to build up a list of tasks. In Rails, Rake is used for common administration tasks, especially sophisticated ones that build off of each other.

    You can get a list of Rake tasks available to you, which will often depend on your current directory, by typing

    ```bash
    $rake --tasks
    ```

    Each task has a description, and should help you find the thing you need.
  </details>

  Stop and commit! Then run `git diff` to see what changed.

1. **Launch the Rails console.**

  The Rails console is a Ruby REPL (like `pry` or `irb`) that comes with Rails and knows about your Rails app.

  ```bash
  rails console
  # or
  rails c
  ```

1. **Confirm that your model exists.**  
  ```ruby
  Speaker
   #=> Speaker(id: integer, first: string, last:string, email:string, created_at: datetime, updated_at: datetime)
  ```

  (You may need to "connect" to your database in the Rails console the first time you do this. Just follow the instructions Rails gives in the console.)

  > Note that we never told our database to add fields for `id`, `created_at` and `updated_at`. These are added automatically, and we generally won't interact with them directly.



1. **Create your first Speaker record!**
  ``` ruby
  # reminder: create = new + save
  Speaker.create({first: "Leroy", last: "Brown"})
  Speaker.count
  Speaker.all  
  ```

  > **Pro-Tip**: Remember, when you're working in the console/repl `up-arrow` is your friend! (That and "hanging a dot" + "double-tabbing").



## Record Creation and Query Challenges


**Create and query Speaker records in the Rails console.**

Here's some data to play with:
```ruby
speakers_data = [
    {:first=>"Cory", :last=>"Fauver", :email=>"cory@example.com"},
    {:first=>"Brianna", :last=>"Veenstra", :email=>"brianna@example.com"},
    {:first=>"Matt", :last=>"Laguardia", :email=>"matt@example.com"},
    {:first=>"Ilias", :last=>"Tsangaris", :email=>"ilias@example.com"}
]
```

* Create 3 new speakers in the Rails Console.

* Delete the last speaker you created.

* Find only the first speaker.

* Find only the last two speakers.

* Find a speaker by id (try id `1`).

* Find a speaker by first name.

* Sort by last name (alphabetically).

* Update the email of the last speaker you created.

* Delete all the speakers you created.

**Resources**:

* ActiveRecord partial method list

    * Class Methods: `all`,  `create`, `count`, `delete_all`, `destroy_all`, `find`, `first`, `last`, `order`, ...

    * Instance Methods:  `delete`, `destroy`,  `save`, `update`, `update_attributes`, ...

* [Active Record Query Interface Rails Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html)

## Seeding Data

1. **Take a look at `db/seed.rb`.**

  Add the following line:
  ```ruby
  p "Hello from seed.rb"
  ```

  Now run the following from your command line (not the console!):
  ```bash
  rake db:seed
  # Hello from seed.rb
  ```

  One interesting thing about your `seed.rb` file is that Rails has set it up to _already_ know about all of the models and gems in your application environment. Just tell it what data to create!

1. **Seed your database with speakers.**

  Create an array of speaker data, with at least three speakers.  Use `Speaker.create` on the array to create all the speakers at once!

  Run `rake db:seed` again, and then check all your speakers from inside the Rails console.

1. **Delete old seed records when you seed.**

  Add a line in your seed file to do `Speakers.delete_all` before the new speakers are created.

  Stop and commit!

1. **Include the [FFaker](https://github.com/ffaker/ffaker) gem in your project.**

  Add the `ffaker` gem to your Gemfile, and then `bundle`.

1. **Update your seed file to use FFaker data.**

  Take a look at the FFaker documentation linked above. Use ``FFaker`` to generate names and email addresses for 10 speakers, and add them to your database.

  > Check out ffaker's [REFERENCE.md](https://github.com/ffaker/ffaker/blob/master/REFERENCE.md) for a comprehensive list of the kind of data available.

  Stop and commit!

## Validations

1. **Add a built-in validator to the `Speaker` model.**

  Rails has built-in validations we can use to validate data before it's saved into the database.

  Conference organizers want some way to get in touch with speakers.  Add a validation inside the `Speaker` model class to make sure each speaker has an email address:

  ```ruby
  # app/models/speaker.rb
  class Speaker < ActiveRecord::Base
    validates :email, presence: true
  end
  ```

1. **Test the validation in Rails console.**

  Back in your Rails console, try creating a speaker without an email address.  You should see `ROLLBACK` in the Rails console instead of `COMMIT`, meaning there was no change to your database.

  Let's use the Rails console to see what happened:

  ```ruby
  > s = Speaker.create({})
     (0.2ms)  BEGIN
     (0.3ms)  ROLLBACK
    => #<Speaker id: nil, first: nil, last: nil, email: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>
  > s.valid?
    => false
  > s.errors.any?
    => true
  > s.errors.messages
    => {:email=>["can't be blank"]}
  ```

  Just as expected, our validation didn't pass, and we got an error message.

  See the Rails Guide on [Validations](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html) for more information on using validations, including how to create custom validations.

  Stop and commit!

## Model Methods

A Rails model is just a class. We can create instance methods to add behaviors we might want to use in other parts of the app.

1. **Add an instance method to the `Speaker` model.**

  Create a simple instance method using `FFaker` to have the speaker do a little speaking:

  ```ruby
  # app/models/speaker.rb
  class Speaker < ActiveRecord::Base
    validates :email, presence: true
    def speechify(blabber_duration=1)
      FFaker::HipsterIpsum.sentence(blabber_duration)
    end
  end
  ```

1. **Use the instance method.**

  In a real Rails app, an instance method might be used in the view.  However, it's a good idea to test it in the Rails console.

  ```ruby
  > Speaker.first.speechify 2
      Speaker Load (0.6ms)  SELECT  "speakers".* FROM "speakers"  ORDER BY "speakers"."id" ASC LIMIT 1
    => "American apparel fab trust fund fixie farm-to-table. Blog mixtape retro +1 organic."
  ```

  Stop and commit!

## Extra Practice & Stretch: `Talk` model


1. Generate a `Talk` model with attributes: `topic` (a string), `duration` (an integer), and `start_time` (a `datetime`).


1. Run `rake db:migrate` to update your schema with this new model, then head over to the Rails console and create a `Talk` instance as a sanity check.


1. Add a validator to your `Talks` model to require that the `start_time` be present.  Also require that the length of the `topic` string be between 3 and 100 characters.


1. Add code to your seed file to create `Talk`s.  Here's some sample data you could use, or create some with FFaker:

  ```ruby
  talks_data = [
      {:topic=>"A Fashion School for Ants?", :duration=>90, :start_time=>DateTime.now-(1.0/24)},
      {:topic=>"Button-down Bliss", :duration=>45, :start_time=>Date.now+(23.0/24)},
      {:topic=>"Ambi-turning", :duration=>30, :start_time=>Date.now+(2.0/24)},
      {:topic=>"The Joy of Jumpsuits", :duration=>30, :start_time=>Date.now+(4.0/24)}
  ]
  ```


1. Using `after_initialize` [ActiveRecord Callback](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_callbacks.html) add default values for a talk's `duration` (e.g., 30) and `topic` (e.g., "TBD").


  <details><summary>hint</summary>
  Create a `add_default_values` instance method to use with `after_initialize`, and be careful not to overwrite a `duration` or `topic` passed in for the instance.
  </details>


1. Try a few complex queries:

* Select all talks with `start_times` in the future.


* Count the number of talks with the default `topic` ("TBD")


* Iterate through all the talks with the default `topic` and `puts` the start time of each. Bonus: format the start time in a more human readable way.

## Future Development Ideas

1. Add routes, controllers, and views for `Speaker` and `Talk` (more on this full process soon!).

1. Create an association (relationship) between speakers and talks (we'll talk about how to do this soon!).
